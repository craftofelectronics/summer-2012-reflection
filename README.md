# Craft of Electronics Summer 2012 Reflection

What, exactly, we might do with these notes is a question. However, we want to capture:

* Some of our design process.
* Reflections on how our products were influenced by our process.

We think we have some really exciting outputs: a very context-centric approach to introducing electronics to students, an open design for a model home in which to conduct this study, and a new piece of software for programming the Arduino. How we got there, and how they mutually influenced each-other may be of interest to others.

Or, it may just be good practice for us to capture our thoughts.
