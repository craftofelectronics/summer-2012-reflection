%Design Local, Deliver Open

\begin{comment} % Notes from initial etherpad
* distributed / open source design is hard
* what does it mean for the course to be open?

* asked what would it mean for a course to be open; decided that we'd be designing for everyone and chose to focus on particular context
* developed personas & worked on understanding values in the context
* realized that distributed & open (course) design is incredibly hard

\section{What does ``open'' mean?}

* FOSS

** OSS/Libre/CC

\section{``Open'' education}

* Open education (in general)

** What's easy

*** Kahn (if you want drill-and-practice)

*** MITx (people use it, do problems)

** What's hard

*** Apprenticeship / Mentoring

*** Hardware (see Open University new course)

\section{What does it mean in context?}

* What did it mean to us?

** Sharing materials?

** Student/community interaction

*** Notional open-hardware interactions

** Distance students?

\section{The Berea Context}

* Student population

* TAD / CS

** Required course

** ``Rebooting'' of course, new curriculum coming out of self-study

** New cross-disciplinary hire

* History of craft at Berea

\section{The Berea Contrast House}

* Nascent idea of model home

** Waived hands

* Concrete realization

** Affordable model developer/provider

** ``A phone call''

* A contextual home

** The Contrast House

\section{Importance of Artifacts}

* Context drives design (CONTEXT IS CRITICAL?)

* Artifacts enable collaboration

** Design processes are not ``open''; design products are open

*** For the process to be open, it must become an artifact unto itself. (How else do you share the process? How, in a word, do you share a table full of sticky notes?)

** House is a rallying point for openness and collaboration

*** (Between us and the MakeCNC)

* Products beget products

** Model house + arduino + curricular materials become an ``educational kit''

** Wiring, videos, questions, etc. all provide guidance for students

** Students can use educational materials (in context)

** Contributors can develop more materials (in context)
