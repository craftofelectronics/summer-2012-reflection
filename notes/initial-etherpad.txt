Things we talked about:

* distributed / open source design is hard
* what does it mean for the course to be open?
* software & course codesign
* what would an open kit look like?
* design process lead back to openness & meaningful context

This (or another paper of hers) may be useful: Buechley, L., and Eisenberg, M. (2008). The LilyPad Arduino: Toward Wearable Engineering for Everyone. Wearable Computing Column in IEEE Pervasive, 7(2), pp. 12-15. (Invited submission)

What order would make sense for this paper? Actually, this is the order in which it happened.

* asked what would it mean for a course to be open; decided that we'd be designing for everyone and chose to focus on particular context
* developed personas & worked on understanding values in the context
* realized that distributed & open (course) design is incredibly hard
* had the miniature house idea to address the learning objectives
* discovered through our process that there was something appropriate for the context, the contrast house
* following through with the notion of the contrast miniature house, we're now able to produce an open kit including instructions that uses the context we chose but makes a useful tool openly available to everyone who's potentially interested in it -- providing them with a way of being introduced to both electronics & computing
